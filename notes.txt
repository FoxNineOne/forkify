Architecture

Structure - Architecture will give us structure (the way we organise our code)
Maintainability - always need to consider the future of the project. "Never really done"
Expandability - We also need to add new feature in the future.

we can also create our Architecture from scratch, but this only is suitable for small, simpler projects


We can use well established architecture patterns like 
    MVC (model view controller)
    MVP (model view presenter)
    Flux

In modern web development, a lot of dev use 
React, Angular, Vue, Svelte to take care of architecture for them
This is a good idea for large scale applications


There are some components that any architecture must have

That is 

Business Logic
    - Code that solves the actual business problem
    - Directly related to what business does and what it needs
    - Example: Sending messages, storing transactions, calculating taxes etc..

State
    - Externally stores all the data about the applications
    - Should be the "single source of truth"
    - UI should be kept in sync with the State
    - State libraries exist (Redux MobX)

HTTP Library
    - Responsible for making and receiving AJAX requests
    - Optional but almost always necessary in the real-world apps
    
Application Logic (Router)
    - Code that is only concerned about the implementation of the application itself
    - Application logic includes handling of the UI events and navigation on the page
    - Mapping actions to users navigation

Presentation Logic
    - Code that is concerned about the visible part of the application
    - is responible for displaying application state on the user interface


The MVC Architecture

    WEB | <- -> {MODEL}  {CONTROLLOER}  {VIEW}  <- -> | USER

model -
    All about the applications data, so
    - State
    - Business Logic
    - HTTP Library 

Controller 
    Bridges between model and views (which don't know about one another)
    Handles UI events and dispatches tasks to model and view
    - Application Logic

View - 
    - Presentation Logic - the part of the application interacting with the user.


One of the goals of the MVC pattern is to separate business logic from application logic
this makes dveloping the application so much easier.
As a consequence, we need something to connect these two parts.. hence controller!
